An investigation after the disaster traced back to certain joints on one of the two solid booster rockets, each containing O-rings that ensured no exhaust gases could escape from the booster.\n\nThe night before the launch was unusually cold, with temperatures below freezing. The final report suggested that the cold snap during the night made the o-rings stiff, and unable to adjust to changes in pressure. As a result, exhaust gases leaked away from the solid booster rockets, causing one of them to break loose and rupture the main fuel tank, leading to the final explosion.\n\nThe question we're trying to answer in this session is: based on the data from the previous flights, would it have been possible to predict the failure of most o-rings on the Challenger flight?\n\n## Load and visualise the data\n\nFirst we load the data, then we visualise it.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchallenger <- read_csv(\"data/challenger.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 23 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (2): temp, damage\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe data set contains several columns:\n\n1.  `temp`, the launch temperature in degrees Fahrenheit\n2.  `damage`, the number of o-rings that showed erosion\n\nBefore we have a further look at the data, let's calculate the proportion of damaged o-rings (`prop_damaged`) and the total number of o-rings (`total`) and update our data set.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchallenger <-\nchallenger %>%\n  mutate(total = 6,                     # total number of o-rings\n         intact = 6 - damage,           # number of undamaged o-rings\n         prop_damaged = damage / total) # proportion damaged o-rings\n\nchallenger\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 23 × 5\n    temp damage total intact prop_damaged\n   <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1    53      5     6      1        0.833\n 2    57      1     6      5        0.167\n 3    58      1     6      5        0.167\n 4    63      1     6      5        0.167\n 5    66      0     6      6        0    \n 6    67      0     6      6        0    \n 7    67      0     6      6        0    \n 8    67      0     6      6        0    \n 9    68      0     6      6        0    \n10    69      0     6      6        0    \n# ℹ 13 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nPlotting the proportion of damaged o-rings against the launch temperature shows the following picture:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(challenger, aes(x = temp, y = prop_damaged)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](glm-practical-logistic-proportion_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe point on the left is the data point corresponding to the coldest flight experienced before the disaster, where five damaged o-rings were found. Fortunately, this did not result in a disaster.\n\nHere we'll explore if we could have predicted the failure of both o-rings on the Challenger flight, where the launch temperature was 31 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n## Creating a suitable model\n\nWe only have 23 data points in total. So we're building a model on not that much data - we should keep this in mind when we draw our conclusions!\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nWe are using a logistic regression for a proportion response in this case, since we're interested in the proportion of o-rings that are damaged.\n\nWe can define this as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm_chl <- glm(cbind(damage, intact) ~ temp,\n               family = binomial,\n               data = challenger)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDefining the relationship for proportion responses is a bit annoying, where you have to give the `glm` model a two-column matrix to specify the response variable.\n\nHere, the first column corresponds to the number of damaged o-rings, whereas the second column refers to the number of intact o-rings. We use the `cbind()` function to bind these two together into a matrix.\n\n:::\n\n## Model output\n\nThat's the easy part done! The trickier part is interpreting the output. First of all, we'll get some summary information.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nNext, we can have a closer look at the results:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(glm_chl)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(damage, intact) ~ temp, family = binomial, \n    data = challenger)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

One thing that the graph shows is that there is a lot of uncertainty involved in this model. We can tell, because the fit of the line is very poor at the lower temperature range. There is just very little data to work on, with the data point at 53 F having a large influence on the fit.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Exercises\n\n### Predicting failure {#sec-exr_failure}\n\n:::{.callout-exercise}\n\n\n{{< level 2 >}}\n\n\n\nThe data point at 53 degrees Fahrenheit is quite influential for the analysis.

This model is not significantly different from the null, i.e., temperature is not a significant predictor. Note that it’s only marginally non-significant, and we do have a high goodness-of-fit value.\n\nIt is possible that if more data points were available that followed a similar trend, the story might be different). Even if we did use our non-significant model to make a prediction, it doesn’t give us a value anywhere near 5 failures for a temperature of 53 degrees Fahrenheit. So overall, based on the model we’ve fitted with these data, there was no indication that a temperature just a few degrees cooler than previous missions could have been so disastrous for the Challenger.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key points\n\n-   We can use a logistic model for proportion response variables\n\n:::\n",
