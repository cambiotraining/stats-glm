This section will discuss new techniques for significance and goodness-of-fit testing, specifically for use with GLMs.\n\n## Libraries and functions\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click to expand\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"lmtest\")\nlibrary(lmtest)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfrom scipy.stats import *\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Deviance\n\nSeveral of the tests and metrics we'll discuss below are based heavily on deviance. So, what is deviance, and where does it come from?\n\nFitting a model using maximum likelihood estimation - the method that we use for GLMs, among other models - is all about finding the parameters that maximise the **likelihood**, or joint probability, of the sample. In other words, how likely is it that you would sample a set of data points like these, if they were being drawn from an underlying population where your model is true? Each model that you fit has its own likelihood.\n\nNow, for each dataset, there is a \"saturated\", or perfect, model. This model has the same number of parameters in it as there are data points, meaning the data are fitted exactly - as if connecting the dots between them. The **saturated model** has the largest possible likelihood of any model fitted to the dataset.\n\nOf course, we don't actually use the saturated model for drawing real conclusions, but we can use it as a baseline for comparison. We compare each model that we fit to this saturated model, to calculate the **deviance**. Deviance is defined as the difference between the log-likelihood of your fitted model and the log-likelihood of the saturated model (multiplied by 2). \n\nBecause deviance is all about capturing the discrepancy between fitted and actual values, it's performing a similar function to the residual sum of squares (RSS) in a standard linear model. In fact, the RSS is really just a specific type of deviance.\n\n![Different models and their deviances](images/deviance.png){width=70%}\n\n## Significance testing\n\nThere are a few different potential sources of p-values for a generalised linear model. \n\nHere, we'll briefly discuss the p-values that are reported \"as standard\" in a typical GLM model output.\n\nThen, we'll spend most of our time focusing on likelihood ratio tests, perhaps the most effective way to assess significance in a GLM.\n\n### Revisiting the diabetes dataset\n\nAs a worked example, we'll use a logistic regression fitted to the `diabetes` dataset that we saw in a previous section.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiabetes <- read_csv(\"data/diabetes.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 728 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): glucose, diastolic, test_result\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ndiabetes_py = pd.read_csv(\"data/diabetes.csv\")\n\ndiabetes_py.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   glucose  diastolic  test_result\n0      148         72            1\n1       85         66            0\n2      183         64            1\n3       89         66            0\n4      137         40            1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nAs a reminder, this dataset contains three variables:\n\n- `test_result`, binary results of a diabetes test result (1 for positive, 0 for negative)\n- `glucose`, the results of a glucose tolerance test\n- `diastolic` blood pressure\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm_dia <- glm(test_result ~ glucose * diastolic,\n                  family = \"binomial\",\n                  data = diabetes)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Python\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nmodel = smf.glm(formula = \"test_result ~ glucose * diastolic\", \n                family = sm.families.Binomial(), \n                data = diabetes_py)\n                \nglm_dia_py = model.fit()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Wald tests\n\nLet's use the `summary` function to see the model we've just fitted.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(glm_dia)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = test_result ~ glucose * diastolic, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = diabetes)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

Specifically, each individual parameter, or coefficient, has its own z-value and associated p-value.\n\nA hypothesis test has automatically been performed for each of the parameters in your model, including the intercept and interaction. In each case, something called a **Wald test** has been performed.\n\nThe null hypothesis for these Wald tests is that the value of the coefficient = 0. The idea is that if a coefficient isn't significantly different from 0, then that parameter isn't useful and could be dropped from the model. These tests are the equivalent of the t-tests that are calculated as part of the `summary` output for standard linear models.\n\nImportantly, these Wald tests *don't* tell you about the significance of the overall model. For that, we're going to need something else: a likelihood ratio test.\n\n### Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)\n\nWhen we were assessing the significance of standard linear models, we were able to use the F-statistic to determine:\n\n- the significance of the model versus a null model, and\n- the significance of individual predictors.\n\nWe can't use these F-tests for GLMs, but we can use LRTs in a really similar way, to calculate p-values for both the model as a whole, and for individual variables.\n\nThese tests are all built on the idea of deviance, or the likelihood ratio, as discussed above on this page. We can compare any two models fitted to the same dataset by looking at the difference in their deviances, also known as the difference in their log-likelihoods, or more simply as a likelihood ratio.\n\nHelpfully, this likelihood ratio approximately follows a chi-square distribution, which we can capitalise on to calculate a p-value. All we need is the number of degrees of freedom, which is equal to the difference in the number of parameters of the two models you're comparing.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nImportantly, we are only able to use this sort of test when one of the two models that we are comparing is a \"simpler\" version of the other, i.e., one model has a subset of the parameters of the other model. \n\nSo while we could perform an LRT just fine between these two models: `Y ~ A + B + C` and `Y ~ A + B + C + D`, or between any model and the null (`Y ~ 1`), we would not be able to use this test to compare `Y ~ A + B + C` and `Y ~ A + B + D`.\n:::\n\n#### Testing the model versus the null\n\nSince LRTs involve making a comparison between two models, we must first decide which models we're comparing, and check that one model is a \"subset\" of the other.\n\nLet's use an example from a previous section of the course, where we fitted a logistic regression to the `diabetes` dataset. \n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nThe first step is to create the two models that we want to compare: our original model, and the null model (with and without predictors, respectively).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm_dia <- glm(test_result ~ glucose * diastolic,\n                  family = \"binomial\",\n                  data = diabetes)\n\nglm_null <- glm(test_result ~ 1, \n                family = binomial, \n                data = diabetes)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, we use the `lrtest` function from the `lmtest` package to perform the test itself; we include both the models that we want to compare, listing them one after another.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlrtest(glm_dia, glm_null)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLikelihood ratio test\n\nModel 1: test_result ~ glucose * diastolic\nModel 2: test_result ~ 1\n  #Df LogLik Df  Chisq Pr(>Chisq)    \n1   4 -374.0                         \n2   1 -468.3 -3 188.59  < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see from the output that our chi-square statistic is significant, with a really small p-value. This tells us that, for the difference in degrees of freedom (here, that's 3), the change in deviance is actually quite big. (In this case, you can use `summary(glm_dia)` to see those deviances - 936 versus 748!)\n\nIn other words, our model is better than the null.\n\n## Python\n\nThe first step is to create the two models that we want to compare: our original model, and the null model (with and without our predictor, respectively).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nmodel = smf.glm(formula = \"test_result ~ glucose * diastolic\", \n                family = sm.families.Binomial(), \n                data = diabetes_py)\n                \nglm_dia_py = model.fit()\n\nmodel = smf.glm(formula = \"test_result ~ 1\",\n                family = sm.families.Binomial(),\n                data = diabetes_py)\n\nglm_null_py = model.fit()\n```\n:::\n\n\nUnlike in R, there isn't a nice neat function for extracting the $\\chi^2$ value, so we have to do a little bit of work by hand.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# calculate the likelihood ratio (i.e. the chi-square value)\nlrstat = -2*(glm_null_py.llf - glm_dia_py.llf)\n\n# calculate the associated p-value\npvalue = chi2.sf(lrstat, glm_dia_py.df_model - glm_null_py.df_model)\n\nprint(lrstat, pvalue)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n188.59314837444526 1.2288700360045209e-40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis gives us the likelihood ratio, based on the log-likelihoods that we've extracted directly from the models, which approximates a chi-square distribution. \n\nWe've also calculated the associated p-value, by providing the difference in degrees of freedom between the two models (in this case, that's simply 1, but for more complicated models it's easier to extract the degrees of freedom directly from the model as we've done here).\n\nHere, we have a large chi-square statistic and a small p-value. This tells us that, for the difference in degrees of freedom (here, that's 1), the change in deviance is actually quite big. (In this case, you can use `summary(glm_dia)` to see those deviances - 936 versus 748!)\n\nIn other words, our model is better than the null.\n:::\n\n### Testing individual predictors\n\nAs well as testing the overall model versus the null, we might want to test particular predictors to determine whether they are individually significant.\n\nThe way to achieve this is essentially to perform a series of \"targeted\" likelihood ratio tests. In each LRT, we'll compare two models that are almost identical - one with, and one without, our variable of interest in each case.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nThe first step is to construct a new model that doesn't contain our predictor of interest. Let's test the `glucose:diastolic` interaction.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglm_dia_add <- glm(test_result ~ glucose + diastolic,\n                  family = \"binomial\",\n                  data = diabetes)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we use the `lrtest` function to compare the models with and without the interaction:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlrtest(glm_dia, glm_dia_add)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLikelihood ratio test\n\nModel 1: test_result ~ glucose * diastolic\nModel 2: test_result ~ glucose + diastolic\n  #Df  LogLik Df  Chisq Pr(>Chisq)\n1   4 -374.00                     \n2   3 -374.32 -1 0.6288     0.4278\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis tells us that our interaction `glucose:diastolic` isn't significant - our more complex model doesn't have a meaningful reduction in deviance.\n\nThis might, however, seem like a slightly clunky way to test each individual predictor. Luckily, we can also use our trusty `anova` function with an extra argument to tell us about individual predictors. \n\nBy specifying that we want to use a chi-squared test, we are able to construct an analysis of deviance table (as opposed to an analysis of variance table) that will perform the likelihood ratio tests for us for each predictor:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(glm_dia, test=\"Chisq\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\nModel: binomial, link: logit\n\nResponse: test_result\n\nTerms added sequentially (first to last)\n\n                  Df Deviance Resid.
