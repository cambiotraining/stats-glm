We hope that at the end of this course you feel like you have a better grasp on what it is we're trying to do, and gained sufficient confidence in your coding skills to implement these statistical concepts in your own research!\n\n\nTo introduce sufficient understanding and coding experience for analysing data with non-continuous response variables.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Course aims\n\nTo know what to do when presented with an arbitrary data set e.g.\n\n1.  Construct\n    a.  a logistic model for binary response variables\n    b.  a logistic model for proportion response variables\n    c.  a Poisson model for count response variables\n    d.  ~~a Negative Binomial model for count response variables~~ (to be added later)\n2.  Plot the data and the fitted curve in each case for both continuous and categorical predictors\n3.  Assess the significance of fit\n4.  Assess assumption of the model\n:::\n"},"formats":{"courseformat-html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":false,"filters":[],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.134","theme":["default","_extensions/cambiotraining/courseformat/theme.scss"],"number-depth":3,"code-copy":true,"revealjs-plugins":[],"bibliography":["references.bib"],"knitr":{"opts_knit":{"cache.path":".knitr_cache"}},"title":"Course overview"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
